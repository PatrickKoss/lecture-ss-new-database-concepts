# Chapter Consensus
In the final section of the lecture, we delved into the criticality of achieving consensus, 
particularly for use in total order broadcast or single leader replication. 
In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the raft library and undertake the implementation of a raft store.

## Task

- [ ] Implement [Storage](patrick-db-raft/src/main.rs)
